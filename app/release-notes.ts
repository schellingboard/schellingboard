// What the footer's version button shows: the 3-5 highlights of each recent
// release, for an organizer who wants to know what changed without leaving the
// app. Written by hand rather than derived from CHANGELOG.md, which lists every
// change and is far too long to read in a modal.
//
// Newest first, and one entry per release: the dates are what tells a reader
// how old the deployment in front of them is, so a release left out makes the
// newest one look older than it is. tests/unit/release-notes.test.ts fails
// until the newest release named in CHANGELOG.md has an entry here.
//
// The first entry may be the release being prepared — "Unreleased", with no
// date, written as the changes land. A deployment built from `main` is running
// exactly those changes, so it is shown like any other entry; cutting the
// release turns it into one by giving it its version and date.
//
// Highlights only, and at most five: what would open a release announcement,
// not everything that shipped. The list is not append-only — when it is full,
// replace the weakest highlight rather than adding a sixth, and re-read it
// against CHANGELOG.md before finalizing the release. See AGENTS.md.
