// Conference Gamma (scheduling phase) gets a realistic, mostly filled grid:
// most sessions are scheduled from its seeded proposals (matched by title),
// plus organizer/attendee extras. Times are Berlin clock times on event day
// 0-2, day 2 running past midnight (09:00 → 03:00). Keep the slots that
// tests/e2e/scheduling.spec.ts relies on free:
//   day 0: Main Hall 16:00 and Garden Terrace 09:00 (asserted free),
//   day 2: Workshop Room from 15:00, Garden Terrace from 16:00 and Main Hall
//          01:00 the following morning (used by tests to create sessions).
// Two more specs book out of that day 2 Workshop Room window and must not
// collide: rsvp.spec.ts takes 20:00, schedule-layout.spec.ts 18:00. The latter
// clicks whichever slot the schedule happens to be scrolled to and then moves
// the booking, so it can never take a slot another spec needs.
// rsvp.spec.ts RSVPs Bob Test to the Opening Keynote, so nothing may run in
// parallel to it and Bob gets no seeded RSVP there (see RSVP seeding).
