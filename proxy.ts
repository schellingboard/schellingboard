     * - locations/  — the seeded room photos in public/, which the admin UI
     *   renders with the admin cookie alone (uploads live under /media)
     * - the manifest and its icons — installing has to work before anyone
     *   has logged in, and Safari fetches the manifest without our cookie
     *   either way. Both are build assets naming the instance, which the
     *   login page shows already
     * - sw.js — the service worker push notifications are delivered to. The
     *   browser fetches it without our cookie, and a login page in its place
     *   takes notifications with it
     *
     * This deliberately does NOT exempt paths by file extension. It used to,

     * uploaded avatar, location image and site map from auth entirely — see
