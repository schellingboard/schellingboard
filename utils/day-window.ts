/**
 * Why a self-booked session doesn't fit the day it was booked on, or null.
 * The session form offers nothing but slots inside the bookings window and on
 * the day's grid, and caps the duration at the window's end, so anything else
 * is a hand-crafted payload — or a form loaded before an organizer moved the
 * window.
 *
 * The session must both start and finish inside the bookings window: the tail
 * between it and the day's end is what organizers keep for the sessions they
 * place themselves.
 *
 * `judge` narrows that to the endpoints the caller is asking about. An editing
 * host may keep an endpoint an organizer placed out of their reach, so only
 * the ones they are actually changing are theirs to answer for.
