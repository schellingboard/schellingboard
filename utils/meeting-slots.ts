// Companion to utils/slots.ts, which owns the schedule grid's slot math: these
// are the same grid, stepped from the same increment, and kept separate only
// because a meeting asks a different question of it (which slots exist on a
// day) than the grid does (how tall a row is, what aligns).
//
// 1-on-1 slots are derived, never stored: a day plus the event's slot
// increment is enough to say which slots exist. Availability rows then key on
// a slot's start instant, which is why changing that increment clears them —
// a coarser grid would re-read a declared half-hour as a full hour.
