# Progress

## Decisions

- Session branch: `claude/spa-schedule`. No pushes (the user's rule).
- ADR 0015 accepted on 2026-10-08.

## Step 1: baseline (2026-10-08)

- `make test-e2e`: 207 passed, 1 flaky (`profile-comments.spec.ts:95`, the known
  load-only flake; passes on retry and alone). The run exits red only because
  `failOnFlakyTests` is on locally.
- `make test-e2e-docker`: 208 passed.
- No failure comes from the last run's commits; no fix step needed.
