# Testing

## Test strategy

See [ADR 0002](adr/0002-testing-strategy.md) for the full rationale. Three tiers, each with a distinct role:

**Unit tests** (Vitest, `tests/unit/`) — pure functions and isolated business rules only. No DB, no I/O.

**Integration tests** (Vitest, `tests/integration/`) — server actions and API route handlers against a real in-memory SQLite DB. Verify post-condition state through a read surface in order of preference: (1) the corresponding GET endpoint, (2) repo read methods, (3) direct DB rows (last resort). Only `redirect()` and `revalidatePath()` are mocked.

**E2E tests** (Playwright, `tests/e2e/`) — behavior that only manifests in a browser: routing, phase-dependent UI, modals, form interaction, mobile layout. Prefer fewer, high-confidence tests over broad coverage.

## Test quality guardrails

- A test that breaks on an internal rename without a user-visible behavior change is a bad test. Rewrite or delete it.
- Never assert on call counts of internal helpers.
- If making a test pass requires reaching into a private, the test is wrong.
- Factories produce minimal entities; tests override only the fields they care about. If a test sets 12 fields, the factory is wrong.
- No cross-test state. Each test builds what it needs.

## TDD workflow

Every code change must follow red → green → refactor. **Do not skip or reorder steps.**

1. Write a failing test that captures the expected behavior.
2. Run the test and confirm it actually fails (see commands below).
3. Implement the minimum code to make it pass.
4. Run the test again and confirm it is green.
5. Refactor if needed — do not touch the test during refactor.

**Exceptions** (apply conservatively):

- Pure UI/layout/styling changes with no behavior change
- Refactors where existing tests already fully cover the changed code

## Running tests

```bash
make test                # Run unit and integration tests (Vitest)
make test-e2e            # Run E2E tests (headless)
make test-e2e-headed     # Run E2E tests (headed, for local dev)
make test-e2e-docker     # Run E2E tests against the production Docker image
```

**Warning**: E2E tests reset the test database before each run. Do not run against production data.

Tests that send real email (in `make test` and `make test-e2e`) are opt-in:
they need a local [mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/) (start it with
`make mailpit`) and the mail variables set in `.env.test.local`:

```bash
# .env.test.local
MAILPIT_API_URL=http://localhost:8025
SMTP_URL=smtp://localhost:1025
SMTP_FROM='Test <mailer-test@test.example>'
```

When these are unset (the default on a fresh checkout), the email tests are
reported as skipped; when they are set but mailpit is unreachable, the tests
fail. CI always sets them (in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and
`.github/workflows/ci-e2e.yml`, where mailpit is started from
`docker-compose.dev.yml` so its image pin lives in one place) and the tests fail
there if the variables go missing, so they can never be silently skipped in CI.

E2E tests run in their own workflow so that they can be skipped for changes
that cannot affect the app — documentation, the landing page, repository
prose. Adding a top-level path that the app doesn't use? Add it to both
`paths-ignore` lists in `.github/workflows/ci-e2e.yml`.

Running another clone or workspace of this project alongside this one? See [Running Multiple Instances](multiple-instances.md) for the ports that have to be kept apart.

Install Playwright browsers before first use:

```bash
make install-playwright
```

Run a single E2E spec, or filter by test title with `-g`:

```bash
bun set-env.ts test bun x playwright test tests/e2e/proposals.spec.ts
bun set-env.ts test bun x playwright test tests/e2e/proposals.spec.ts:42   # single test by line
bun set-env.ts test bun x playwright test -g "creates a proposal"          # by title substring
```

The suite runs as two projects. `firefox` holds everything and runs in
parallel; `firefox-globals` holds the specs that change site-wide settings —
one row every other test reads — and depends on `firefox`, so it starts only
once the parallel bulk is done and has the site to itself. It runs on a single
worker, so its specs don't race each other either. `settings.spec.ts` is the
only member today; add a spec here (via `GLOBALS_MUTATING_SPECS` in
`playwright.config.ts`) when it mutates a singleton rather than data of its
own.

The price of the dependency: a failure anywhere in `firefox` skips
`firefox-globals` altogether, so those specs report nothing until the bulk is
green again. Run them on their own to see where they stand. That also pulls in
the whole project they depend on, so pass `--no-deps`:

```bash
bun set-env.ts test bun x playwright test tests/e2e/settings.spec.ts --no-deps
```

Run against a different environment (e.g. dev database — still resets it):

```bash
bun set-env.ts dev bun x playwright test
```

## Release-upgrade tests

Every other tier starts from a database this checkout's migrations built. A
self-hoster's does not: it was written by an older release and is migrated
forward when they pull a new image. `tests/integration/release-upgrade.test.ts`
covers that path — for each stored release it restores that release's seeded
database, lets the repositories migrate it (what starting the app does), and
then checks that

- every migration applied, and the result has the same shape as a fresh
  database — same columns, foreign keys and indexes;
- the old release's data still reads back through the repositories;
- creating, updating and deleting works for proposals, votes, sessions, rooms,
  days, RSVPs, comments, guests and the site settings.

It runs in `make test` like any other integration test; the whole set takes a
few seconds. It is deliberately shallow — enough to catch a migration that only
fails against real data, or a read path that assumes a shape only new rows
have, not an exhaustive replay of every feature.

The fixtures are SQL dumps of a release's seeded database in
`tests/fixtures/upgrade/`, one per **distinct schema** rather than per release:
a release that ships no migration reaches the same database as the one before
it, so it needs no dump of its own. Record one while finalizing the changelog,
in the release commit itself (see [Releasing a New
Version](releasing.md)):

```bash
make dump-release-db VERSION=v3.5.0
```

The dump has to come from the release itself — its schema, its seed script. At
that point that is the working tree, which the script seeds with the `small`
profile into a scratch database of its own. Recording a version that is already
tagged instead checks the tag out into a throwaway `git worktree` and seeds it
there, so a dump taken after the fact still comes from the released code. When
the release applies the same migrations as a dump that already exists, no dump
is written.

`tests/fixtures/upgrade/releases.json` says which dump covers which release, so
a release without one is on the record instead of just missing:

```json
{ "v3.4.1": "v3.4.0" } // no migrations of its own, v3.4.0's dump covers it
```

The tests hold that file to the changelog — every released version has to
appear in it, so a forgotten `make dump-release-db` fails `make test` in the
release commit rather than quietly leaving a version untested. They also check
the other direction: every dump the file names exists, and every stored dump is
named.

Dumps are never edited or regenerated: an old one is a record of what that
release actually wrote, and `make dump-release-db` refuses to overwrite one.
When support for upgrading from old versions is dropped, delete those dumps,
drop their `releases.json` entries, and raise `oldestSupported` to the oldest
version still covered.

## Testing the Docker image

`make test-e2e` runs the suite against `next build && next start`, which is not
what we ship. The image runs the standalone build as `node server.js`, as a
different user, with the database, migrations and uploads on a mounted `/data`
volume. `make test-e2e-docker` runs the same suite against a container built
from the working tree, which is the only tier that covers that gap:

```bash
make test-e2e-docker                     # build the image, then run the suite against it
IMAGE=schellingboard/schellingboard:v3.1.0 \
  bun set-env.ts test bash scripts/e2e-docker.sh    # test an existing image instead of building

# A subset, same arguments as `playwright test`:
bun set-env.ts test bash scripts/e2e-docker.sh tests/e2e/proposals.spec.ts
```

It is not part of `make precommit` — it builds an image and takes a few
minutes. The release workflow runs it against the image it is about to publish
and refuses to publish if it fails (see [Releasing a New
Version](releasing.md)), so the reason to run it by hand is a change to the
`Dockerfile`, the standalone build, or anything touching paths, uploads or
migrations — well before a release rather than at one.

What it does, and why each piece is there:

- **Picks a free port** and starts the container on it, then waits for
  `/api/health`.
- **Builds through `scripts/docker-build.sh`**, the script `make docker-build`
  and the release workflow run too — same build arguments, same `:<version>`
  tag, so what gets published is what was tested. (In the release workflow the
  build comes first and is handed here by name in `IMAGE`, so the very image
  that is pushed is the one the suite ran against.) The version is the one
  `scripts/app-version.js` prints, which is also what the footer shows.
- **Bind-mounts `.e2e-docker/`** (gitignored) as `/data`. Seeding runs on the
  host, as usual, and writes to the same SQLite file and uploads directory the
  container reads — so no seeding code has to exist inside the image. The
  directory is deleted at the start of every run, since a stale database hides
  exactly the failures this run looks for. Seeding migrates the database first,
  so what the container's own migration run covers is that `drizzle/` shipped
  and loads, not applying migrations to an empty database.
- **Runs the container as your own uid** (`--user`), so the files it writes
  into the bind mount don't end up owned by the image's uid 1001 and
  unremovable. As a consequence `/app` isn't writable, so Next's image
  optimizer gets a tmpfs for its cache — otherwise every optimized image logs
  an `EACCES`.
- **Starts mailpit if it isn't already running**, because once the mail
  variables are set the email specs fail rather than skip. One it started
  itself is stopped again afterwards, unless the run failed — then it is left
  up, since its web UI is where a failing email test is diagnosed.
- **Points `SITE_URL` and the SMTP host at the container's view of the host**
  (`host.docker.internal`), so emails link back to the right port and reach
  mailpit.

Playwright starts no server of its own here: the script sets
`E2E_EXTERNAL_SERVER=1` and `E2E_PORT`, and `playwright.config.ts` omits its
`webServer` when it sees them.

**The container runs in UTC.** That is what makes this tier worth having: with
`next start`, the server and the browser share your machine's timezone, so a
component that formats a date in the ambient zone renders identically on both
sides and its hydration mismatch stays invisible. In the image it does not.
Dates must be formatted in an explicit zone — the event's — never the process's.

## Flake hunting

A test that fails once in twenty runs is invisible to a normal `make test-e2e`.
`scripts/e2e-flake-hunt.sh` runs the suite repeatedly and keeps the evidence, so
flakes can be ranked by failure rate instead of by whoever noticed one last:

```bash
scripts/e2e-flake-hunt.sh                      # 20 runs of the whole suite
scripts/e2e-flake-hunt.sh 5 -- tests/e2e/voting.spec.ts --repeat-each=3
nohup scripts/e2e-flake-hunt.sh 20 > flake-hunt.log 2>&1 &   # overnight
```

Everything lands in `.flake-hunt/<UTC timestamp>/` (gitignored): `meta.json`
(commit, worker count, machine), then one `run-NNN/` per iteration holding that
run's `results.json` (the Playwright JSON report), its console log, and traces
of whatever failed. Traces are recorded with `--trace=retain-on-failure`, so a
failure comes with network log, console and per-action DOM snapshots — open one
with `bun x playwright show-trace <path>`.

The app is built and started **once** for the whole hunt, not per run: a
`next build` per iteration would dominate the runtime, while the part that has
to repeat — reseeding the database in `globalSetup` — still happens once per
run. Retries are forced to 0: the hunt wants raw failure rates, not
Playwright's own flake classification.

Two knobs, both environment variables:

- `E2E_WORKERS=N` — passed on as `--workers`. Setting it at or above the core
  count overloads the CPU deliberately, which makes timing-dependent flakes
  surface in far fewer runs.
- `HUNT_KEEP_PASSING=0` — shrink green runs' `results.json` to their stats
  block. Only worth it for very long hunts: the report still counts those runs
  as passes, but their per-test durations are gone, so the duration-outlier
  section is left looking at the red runs alone.

The hunt ends by aggregating itself. To re-aggregate, or to compare a hunt from
before a fix with one from after:

```bash
bun scripts/e2e-flake-report.ts .flake-hunt/<ts>
bun scripts/e2e-flake-report.ts .flake-hunt/<before> .flake-hunt/<after>
```

The report — printed and written to `report.md` in the last directory given —
lists flaky tests (failed in some runs, passed in others) with their failure
rate, normalized error signature and the runs whose traces to open; persistent
failures separately, since failing every time is a breakage rather than a
flake; tests whose p95 duration is within striking distance of their timeout;
and failures grouped by signature, which is what reveals that several tests
share one root cause.

If the mail variables are set in `.env.test.local`, start mailpit (`make
mailpit`) before a hunt — otherwise the email specs fail identically in every
run and clutter the report as persistent failures.

## Flaky tests

Locally the suite retries a failing test **once**, and a test that then passes
still fails the run (`failOnFlakyTests`). The retry is not leniency, it is
evidence: `trace: on-first-retry` records nothing when nothing is retried, so
without it a local flake left an error message and no way to look into it. Now
it leaves `test-results/<test>-retry1/trace.zip`, and the terminal ends with a
`flaky` section naming the test — which also tells you at a glance whether the
test is flaky or plain broken, since a broken one fails both attempts. Open the
trace with:

```bash
bun x playwright show-trace test-results/<test>-retry1/trace.zip
```

A second local retry would buy only a failure rate out of three, at the price of
running every genuinely failing test three times while you work — measuring
rates is what [Flake hunting](#flake-hunting) is for.

CI is the other way round: it retries twice and stays green, because nobody is
watching a run to interrupt, and a suite that goes red on a known flake gets
ignored wholesale. So the run records instead of failing:

- **Error annotations** — Playwright's own `github` reporter annotates every
  failed attempt with its error message and location, flaky tests included. So
  a green run can carry red annotations: they are a failed attempt, not a
  failed run.
- **Warning annotations** — `scripts/ci-flaky-summary.ts` reads the JSON report
  and emits one `::warning` per test Playwright classified as flaky, plus a
  table in the job summary — the part the reporter cannot do, and the one that
  survives being scrolled past.
- **The `playwright-report` artifact** (14 days) holds the html report, the JSON
  report and `test-results/` — including the trace of the failed attempt, since
  `trace: on-first-retry` records exactly that one. Download it, unzip it and
  open the trace with `bun x playwright show-trace <path>`.

A flaky warning is a test that failed for a reason; treat it as a bug to be
diagnosed from that trace, not as noise. CI's retries stay at 2 until the suite
is stable — the aim there is to measure flakiness, not to start failing on it.

## E2E conventions

- Imitate human behavior — click visible elements, navigate naturally
- Use semantic locators (`getByRole`, `getByText`, `getByLabel`), not IDs or CSS classes
- Never construct URLs with internal IDs or replay raw API payloads
- Never assert on a global aggregate of shared data — an exact total, "first in the list". The
  whole suite shares one database and runs in parallel, so another spec creating a user or editing
  a profile can move any of them. Assert within data the test created itself, or between two named
  seeded rows ("Alice sorts above Ahmad"), which stays true however many rows appear around them.
  Comparing one count against another (fewer after a filter than before) holds only where no row a
  parallel spec can add moves the two the same way
- Give anything a test creates a name of its own (`E2E Admin User ${uniqueSuffix()}`), distinctive
  enough that no other spec's search or filter can match it. Take the suffix from
  `tests/e2e/helpers/unique.ts`, never a bare `Date.now()`: workers are separate processes sharing
  one database, and two of them can land in the same millisecond
- A cross-test invariant that only a comment states ("no other test votes on this proposal") is
  enforced by nothing. Put it in the seed or the fixture where it can be relied on, or write the
  assertion so it does not need the invariant
- Nothing a page does in an effect is covered by an assertion the server render already satisfies.
  `toHaveCount(0)` on something the markup never contained passes instantly, and a click on a
  server-rendered control satisfies every actionability check a moment before React attaches its
  handler — so both come up green while hydration is still pending. Where the behavior under test
  lives in an effect, wait for that effect's own result before acting on it: `kiosk.spec.ts` polls
  until the `kiosk` cookie is gone before it navigates on, `helpers/user.ts` taps the chip again
- The unattended reminder tick is off (`REMINDER_DISPATCH_INTERVAL_MS=0` in
  `.env.test`, and in the allowlist `scripts/e2e-docker.sh` forwards to the
  container). The seed dates every fixture relative to `new Date()`, so a live
  tick would drop unrelated mail into the mailbox the delivery assertions
  search, and unrelated notifications into the lists the notification tests
  read — flaky by time of day, and worst in the Docker tier. That variable is
  the only thing that turns the tick off: unsetting SMTP does not, since a
  reminder is delivered in the app whether or not it can also be mailed. A
  test that needs reminders delivered clicks **Send due reminders** on the
  `?dev=1` toolbar, which runs one dispatch against the dev clock

## Use cases

`tests/use-cases.ts` catalogues what attendees, hosts and organizers can do,
one line per user goal ("Attendee votes on a proposal"), not per UI step or
edge case. Use cases are grouped into numbered features, and each gets an ID
from its feature and user story number: `005-US1`. IDs are permanent: retire a
use case with `status: "deprecated"` rather than renumbering. A use case not
built yet gets `status: "planned"`, so the report doesn't list it as uncovered.

Tests declare the use cases they cover:

```ts
// E2E: required; tags go at the end of the title
test("votes on a proposal @005-US1", async ({ page }) => {});

// Vitest: optional; for a whole file, as its first line
// @module-tag 005-US1
// …or for one test or describe block, type-checked against the catalogue
it("rejects a voter outside the event", { tags: ["005-US1"] }, () => {});
```

`make test` fails on an E2E test without a use case and on any ID missing from
the catalogue. Run the tests for one use case with
`bun set-env.ts test bun x playwright test -g @005-US1` or
`bun set-env.ts test bun x vitest run --tags-filter 005-US1`.

`make use-cases` prints how many tests in each tier claim each use case, which
use cases no test covers, and which have so many E2E tests that some are
probably redundant. CI adds the same report to the test job's summary. The
counts are claims, not measured coverage: a tag says what a test is for, not
how well it checks it.

## Test data

Each E2E run starts from a clean database with 3 events (Alpha/Beta/Gamma) in different phases, plus pre-created proposals, sessions, users, and auth. See `tests/reset-database.ts` for details. Auth helpers: `tests/helpers/auth.ts` (`login`, `loginAndGoto`).
